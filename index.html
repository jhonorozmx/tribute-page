            He is one of the most famous and influential artists of all time,
            but Vincent van Gogh struggled in obscurity during his brief life.
            Born in the village of Groot-Zundert, Holland on March 30, 1853, van
            Gogh was born into a religious, upper middle class family and after
            much traveling and various unfulfilling occupations, he took up
            painting with almost no formal training. His tremendous oeuvre of
            landscapes, still-lifes, portraits and sketches with their vibrant
            colors and subjective perspective would revolutionize how the world
            viewed art. He fought depression and mental illness while creating
            an intense and arresting universe of images. Popular retellings of
            his tragic story include Vincente Minnelli’s Hollywood biopic Lust
            for Life (1956) with Kirk Douglas and Robert Altman’s quirky Vincent
            and Theo (1990) starring Tim Roth. His life also inspired Don
            McLean’s 1971 hit song “Vincent” and an animated feature is due out
            this year. But no film or song can completely capture the tumultuous
            journey of this conflicted soul.
